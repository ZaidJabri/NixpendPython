### SQL Questions:

I started the process of solving the SQL questions by employing a traditional approach, employing pencil and paper to understand the database schema's construction. I used the LIVE SQL environment to construct the tables and applied SQL queries to these tables to verify the accuracy of my solutions.

### Python Code:

My journey started with data transfer mechanisms, specifically from Template A to Template B. Also, this phase involved an understanding of how to build QR codes. I used YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow, and other websites.

After form submission, the data transfers from `form.html` to `view.html`. With the successful implementation of this data transfer process, I started work on the integration of QR code functionality and how to add the QR code to the PDF file and open it immediately after clicking the submit button.

My approach was characterized by research and detailed testing procedures, especially in the creation of PDF files and the integration of QR codes into these documents. I encountered challenges, including the transmission of data through URLs to templates and scanning the QR code.

### Testing:

To validate the functionality of the code, I employed a practical testing approach. After generating the QR code, I captured an image of it and utilized my laptop's camera to scan the QR code displayed on my phone screen. This testing methodology served as a validation of the QR code functionality.
